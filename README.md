# SIMA-S2S User Guide
Welcome to the SIMA-S2S user guide. This is a guide for running initialized subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts with the SIMA framework.

## SIMA
[The System for Integrated Modeling of the Atmosphere (SIMA)](https://sima.ucar.edu/) is a unified community atmospheric modeling framework, for use in an Earth System Model, such as the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The current incarnation of SIMA enables diverse configurations of the atmosphere model inside of [CESM](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models), for applications spanning minutes to centuries and cloud to global scales, including atmospheric forecasts and projections of the atmospheric state and composition from the surface into the thermosphere.
